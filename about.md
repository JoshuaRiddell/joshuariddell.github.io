I am an Undergraduate Mechatronic Engienering student, currently working in the Distributed Sensing Systems group at [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/) (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia).
  
My interests lie in electromechanical design and writing software which runs on these designs.
