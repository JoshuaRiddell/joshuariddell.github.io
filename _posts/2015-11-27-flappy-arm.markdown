## Overview

FlappyArm is a crowd controlled robotic arm developed by myself, [Dragan Marjanovic](https://github.com/draganmarjanovic) and [Abhishek Jagtap](https://github.com/abhijagtap) on the 48 hour hackathon, [QUT Hack](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/quthack-tickets-19563321421). Players log in to a locally hosted web interface on a device with a web browser. They are then given a slider which allows them to control one degree of freedom on the 6DOF robotic arm. The arm was 3D printed and assembled by me, using [3D models](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30163) by ["ancastrog"](http://www.thingiverse.com/ancastrog/about) on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/).

Below is a short demo video. It was possible to pick up the cube and put it into the containers - we had our hands full on the day so taking a video was quite difficult.
