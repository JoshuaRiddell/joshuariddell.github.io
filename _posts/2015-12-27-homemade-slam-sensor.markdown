## Aim

The aim of this project was to:

* refine my mechanical design and manufacturing skills;
* gain experience in creating electrical connections over moving parts;
* create a basic SLAM (simultaneous location and mapping) sensor at a low cost;
* design basic location algorithms.

## Hardware Design

# Worm Gear-set

The motor I had handy ran at approximately 11,000RPM@5V (no load). I thought that approximately 120RPM would be a reasonable speed for the sensor rotor since I was not aiming for a very high speed sensor, and higher speeds meant more problems with balancing.
