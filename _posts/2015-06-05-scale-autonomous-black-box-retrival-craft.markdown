## Aim  {#aim}

This was my first university level project. The aims were:

* to achieve a good grade;
* learn about coordinating and working in a team;
* producing a working prototype;
* balancing workload across courses.

## Hardware Design  {#hardware-design}

The requirements of the hypothetical tender were to:

* have a sustainable design;
* be constructed using basic hand tools;
* fit inside 200&times;200&times;200mm box (150&times;150&times;150mm for bonus);
* comply with $100 budget ($75 for bonus);
* completely autonomous;
* power for 2&times;5 minute deployments;
* weigh less than 0.5kg for bonus.

The team set out to achieve all of these goals including the bonus specifications.

The main hull design was mocked up at a team meeting to ensure the design was feasable. This is shown below. (Note that the craft is upside down in these images).

After this meeting two hull designs were built to see which was most stable in the water and which had the best shape. These were contstructed of foam, acrylic sheet and the independent variable was the vessel being aluminium cans or plastic bottles.
